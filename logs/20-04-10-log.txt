Also, make it act like real space, Ie. Not hearing gunshots if your in space, bombs would make just a kind of deafened explosion sound, and sound wouldn&#39;t be there because, well, in real life there&#39;s no sound in space. It would be really cool, I think. Also, can you add in breathing sounds for when you have a O2 tank on? All these sound effects would be very cool
