OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Rather fun outcomes actually.
GAME: Ridley4 entered as Jane Hammelyn
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Experimenting with siphons mostly.
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : I miss the old air system, on that note.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Was actually gonna do something else, but these things are fascinating me now
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : It was awesome how things could be sucked out by rushing air.
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : It actually made an airbomb good for more than inducing hyperoxia.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Yeah, but it was easily abused for crashes.
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Oh?
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Well, there are ways to do the same thing, but it requires thought.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : But right now, I&#39;m intruigied by these siphons
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : What was the cause, may I ask?
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Position recalculations
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Ah, yes.
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Just like shoving the station&#39;s goods into a single locker.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : mmm.
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Where opening it can cripple the server.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Well, opening it doesn&#39;t cripple the server, but it makes a GREAT anti right click trap
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Dwarf bombs were also pretty nasty,
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Mmm. I had one, potentially, here in atmos.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : I&#39;m still trying to figure WTF is going on here.
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Reminds me of the old old original map&#39;s engine.

OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : I tihnk it may&#39;ve been rather revised though.
OOC: Cerberius Grey/Cecilff2 : Yota optimized it

OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : It was based on standardized modules.
OOC: Cerberius Grey/Cecilff2 : Yes I still prefer the original design the most.  And as for the air code, I have the original source, I can take a look

OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : It&#39;s constantly fluxing from 8k to 20.

OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : I have a theory.
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : It&#39;s only sucking out nitrogen.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Yeah.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Everything BUT oxygen
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Siphons were probably modded from that, then.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : I threw an incineeary in there to see what happened, and they went out almost instantly
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : They used to just suck up all atmosphere around them.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Temp is dropping in here to.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Well, thats the thing, normally they suck everything
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Ah, I thought they may have been changed to be selective.

OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Seems so.
OOC: Cerberius Grey/Cecilff2 : Jeez what&#39;d you guys do in here?
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Not that high actually. The vat system is inefficent,
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Pressure is rising.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : I did this to try and test something with incinderary grenades.
OOC: Cerberius Grey/Cecilff2 : And yeah why is pressure rising here
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Then I broke the air
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Likely leak.
OOC: Cog Wallforge/Beorn080 : Ya, you exhale, evidentally 30% oxy 70% co2
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : That said I did get some 1k% of pressure.
OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Sounds about right actually.
